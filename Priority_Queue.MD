# Priority Queue

Priority Queue is an abstract data type that is similar to a queue, and every element has some priority value associated with it. The priority of the elements in a priority queue determines the order in which elements are served (i.e., the order in which they are removed). <br>

* enqueue(): This function is used to insert new data into the queue.
* dequeue(): This function removes the element with the highest priority from the queue.
* peek()/top(): This function is used to get the highest priority element in the queue without removing it from the queue.

Priority queue can be implemented using the following data structures: 

* Arrays.
* Linked list.
* Heap data structure.
* Binary search tree.

| Arrays  | enqueue()  | dequeue()  | peek()  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time Complexity  | O(1)  | O(n)  |  O(n) |
