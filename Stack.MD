# Stack

![Stack](/images/stack.png)

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. _The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out)._ <br>

**Important facts:**

* First-in, last-out (FILO) data structure.
* Equivalent of a real-life pile of papers on desk.
* In stack terms, to insert is to push, and to remove is to pop.
* Often implemented on top of a linked list where the head is used for both insertion and removal. Can also be implemented using dynamic arrays.
